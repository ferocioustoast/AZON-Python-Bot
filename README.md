# AZON_Python_Bot
Learning some Pythons by making an amazon giveaway bot

This one uses main giveaway site and some fancy python to not need mouse and keyboard control

The login.txt file is optional and allows you to give it a email and password to use otherwise it will wait for you to enter on sign in page

Only tested with Firefox and Windows 10
Firefox basically required because browser = webdriver.Firefox()
